# Libasm
my first look at assembly language for the 42 school project.

Graded 125 work with all the bonuses funcion.
The main.c file is for test, and run several check

it also check if Errno is set in the right way when something goes wrong in ft_write, ft_read and all the funcion that use Malloc.

For the bonus part just Atoi_base has severe tests, the list part run just a few test.
