# Libasm
my first look at assembly language for the 42 school project.

![Cromalde's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/cromalde/libasm)

The main.c file is for test, and run several check

it also check if Errno is set in the right way when something goes wrong in ft_write, ft_read and all the funcion that use Malloc.

For the bonus part just Atoi_base has severe tests, the list part run just a few test.
